<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is a sample website made with <a href="https://www.soupault.app">soupault</a>.</p>
<p>You can use it as a template for your own website, or simply learn from its setup.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The configuration is in the <code>soupault.conf</code> file.</li>
  <li>Page source files are in <code>site/</code>.</li>
  <li>Page template is in <code>templates/main.html</code>.</li>
  <li>Navigation menu link highlighting is done by the <code>section-link-highlight</code> plugin.</li>
  <li>Lua plugins are stored in <code>plugins/</code>. You can find more plugins at <a href="https://www.soupault.app/plugins/">soupault.neocities.org/plugins</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this is intentionally a "no moving parts" setup.</p>
<p>
One of the special powers of soupault is that
it can use external programs as data sources. For example, you can use a Markdown processor of your choice
to convert <code>*.md</code> pages to HTML before further processing. You can also run the content of
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements through any syntax highlighter, insert output of programs into your
pages and more.
</p>
<p>
Of course you will need those programs in your build environment. This setup is intentionally limited
to built-in features and Lua plugins so that it will work on any environment.
Consult the <a href="https://www.soupault.app/reference-manual/">documentation</a> to learn
how to integrate soupault's workflow with external programs.
