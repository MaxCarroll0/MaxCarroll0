  <paper-abstract>We explore how to provide programmers with an interactive interface for explaining the process by which
static types and dynamic casts are derived, with the goal of improving the debugging of static and dynamic
type errors. To this end, we define mathematical foundations for a decomposable highlighting system within
a bidirectional system, and show how these can be propagated through dynamic types in a cast system. Our
prototype implementation in the gradually typed Hazel language includes a web-based user interface, through
which we highlight the importance of type level debugging.</paper-abstract>

## Notes
Primarily a summary, and extended discussion upon previous work conducted as part of my [undergraduate dissertation](/papers/undergrad-dissertation).
