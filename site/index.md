This is a sample [soupault](https://soupault.app) blog setup that you can make your own.

You can edit this text in `site/index.md`. For example, greet your readers
and introduce yourself and your blog.

<h2 id="latest-entries-header">Latest posts</h2>

<div id="latest-blog-entries">
  <!-- The blog-summary index view will insert titles of the latest 10 entries here.
       To change the behaviour or styling,
       edit the [index.views.blog-summary] section in soupault.toml
    -->
</div>
