<h1>First post</h1> <!-- Automatically used for the post title -->

<!--
    The content of the date#post-date element is picked up as a post date.
    You can change that in the [index.fields] settings of soupault.conf
  -->
<div>Date: <time id="post-date">1970-01-01</time> </div>

<p>
This is the first post in this blog. There isn't much content and it's mostly
to demonstrate how to create a post. This is the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in this page,
and it becomes the post excerpt visible in the feed.
You can change that behaviour in the <code>[index.fields]</code> section of <code>soupault.conf</code>.

I cannot think of a good second paragraph for an introductory post.
