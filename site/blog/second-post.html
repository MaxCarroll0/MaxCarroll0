<h1>Second post</h1>

<p>
Sometimes the first paragraph is introductory and doesn't make a good excerpt for the blog feed.
This is why soupault allows multiple selectors with automatic fallback.
In our <code>soupault.conf</code>, under <code>[index.fields.excerpt]</code> we have
<code>selector = ["#summary", "p"]</code>. It means that soupault will try to find an element with
<code>id="summary"</code> first and resort to the first paragraph if there's no such element.
Thus we can mark any paragraph as a post excerpt.

<p id="summary">
This post doesn't have much content either, it just demonstrates how to use a paragraph other than the first
for the post excerpt. In most other static site generators you'd have to duplicate the entire excerpt
in the front matter to do that.
