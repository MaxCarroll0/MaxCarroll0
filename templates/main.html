<!--
    This is the default page template.

    In soupault's terminology, a "page template" is simply an HTML file devoid of content.
    It parses HTML into an element tree much like browsers do and then modifies it,
    then saves modified HTML to a static page.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">

    <!-- Page title is set by the title widget based on its heading -->

      It can be inserted inside any element identifiable with a CSS3 selector,
